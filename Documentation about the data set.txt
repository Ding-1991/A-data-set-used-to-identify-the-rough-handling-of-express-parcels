This data set is mainly used for the training and testing of the identification model for the rough handling of express parcels.
The data set contains samples of 4 common types of express parcel processing, namely normal operation, dropping, kicking and throwing.
The total number of samples in the data set is 2535. And all labels are manually marked.
In addition to category labels, the data set also provides some additional information, such as package size, drop height, etc., to provide support for other studies.
The format of the data in the dataset is mat. You can use matlab, python to read.
Each sample corresponds to a mat file, which is a 3¡ÁN matrix. 3 corresponds to the 3 axis x, y, z. N corresponds to the sampling point.
The data of all samples have some redundancy, so that other researchers can use their own methods to intercept data.
Samples of different categories are placed in different folders.
This data set will be continuously expanded and updated.
